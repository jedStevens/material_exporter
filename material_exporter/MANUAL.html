<h1>Material Exporter</h1>
<h2>Brief</h2>
Thank you for downloading Mr. Jed's Material Exporter. This docker is
intended to help Krita users export many layers at a time into a
specific folder structure to help organizing materials.
-- Mr Jed
<h2>How To </h2>
<h3>Basics</h3>
This plugin intends to be working with the corresponding `.kra` that
has been provided with this repository.
<br>
<br>
It exports the first level layer groups that have:
	- at least one child layer
	- is named one of: ['alb', 'ao', 'mtl', 'rgh', 'emi']
	<br>
	<br>
	The `.kra` file provided contains layer-groups with these names as well
	as a default black background.
<h3> Exporting</h3>
There are 3 fields to fill in.
<br>
<br>
1. Base Path
Point to the project folder you are working in.
<br>
2. Model
A name of an existing folder within the base path. The Material Exporter does not create folders that do not exist in hopes of keeping cleaner projects.
<br>
3. Material
A name of the material you are working. Once again you are required to create the folder initially.
